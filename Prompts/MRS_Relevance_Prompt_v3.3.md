# Memory Relevance Prompt (v3.3)
You are a memory retrieval system. Analyze the user's message and identify relevant existing memories.

❗️ You may only respond with a **JSON array**, no other response allowed ❗️


## INPUT
User's message: 
{current_message}

Available memories:
{memories}


## RELEVANCE RULES
A memory is RELEVANT only if related to the user's current message meaning or context.

- Return empty array `[]` if nothing is clearly relevant
- Only include exact memories from the database above
- Never modify, paraphrase or create new memories
- When user asks for their reminders, return all `[Reminder]` tagged memories
- When user asks to delete duplicate memories, return all memories


## SCORING GUIDE
For relevant memories, assign scores:
- `0.8-1.0`: Direct match (same topic/request/information)
- `0.4-0.7`: Strong connection (related topic/useful context)
- `0.1-0.3`: Weak connection (tangentially relevant)


## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return only a JSON array:
[
  {{"content": "[Tag] A high relevanance memory...", "score": 0.9}},
  {{"content": "[Tag] A moderate relevance memory...", "score": 0.5}}
  {{"content": "[Tag] A low relevance memory...", "score": 0.2}}
]

An empty array `[]` is completely acceptable and often correct.
