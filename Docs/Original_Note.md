### Note to Self: Insights on Qwen2.5 32B and Strategy for v4.2 Redesign

Hey Cody, as we wrap up this session with Philip on refining the memory identification prompt, jotting down key learnings here to guide our collaborative VSCode work. This is based on analyzing multiple monologue tests (verbatim-aligned vs. obfuscated), output comparisons across prompt versions), and patterns in Qwen's behavior under hardware constraints (RTX 5090, large context for DB memories). The goal is to evolve v4.1 into something that plays to Qwen's strengths without losing too much of its detailed nuance—remember, we're optimizing for reliability in a restricted setup, not perfection.

#### Findings on Qwen2.5 32B's Capabilities

From the tests, Qwen shines in scenarios where tasks are structured and pattern-based: it consistently nails JSON-only outputs, follows sequential steps (e.g., analyze > decide > format), and handles basic semantic inference well when inputs match prompt phrasing closely (e.g., accurate tagging and updates on "easy" monologues). It's efficient for local runs, avoiding the chattiness of models like Llama or Mistral, and it can apply simple rules like DELETE + NEW pairs or ignoring duplicates with high fidelity. However, as a mid-sized 32B model, it has clear limits under cognitive load: it struggles with complex, multi-step computations (like stacked modifier math or deep triage hierarchies), leading to inconsistencies such as over-consolidated entries, inflated/under-scored importances, or outright misses (e.g., repeatedly skipping [Question] tags). On non-verbatim inputs, it relies heavily on pattern-matching from examples, often anchoring to them so strongly that it overrides abstract directives—resulting in hallucinations like invented tags or including low-importance trivia despite ignore rules. It performs better with paraphrase detection when guided by diverse examples, but heavy context (e.g., full DB memories) amplifies these issues, causing shortcuts or degraded accuracy (e.g., 15-20% drop in coverage on "hard" tests). Overall, Qwen is pragmatic and rule-abiding but not robust for abstract reasoning or precision under ambiguity—it's like a reliable mid-level coder who thrives on clear specs and examples but gets overwhelmed by overly intricate requirements.

#### General Strategy for Redesigning Prompt v4.2

To align v4.2 with these capabilities, focus on reducing cognitive overhead while leveraging Qwen's affinity for examples and structured flows—aim for a "lighter, example-guided" evolution that preserves core nuance (e.g., detailed categories, semantic rules) but makes it more digestible for a 32B model in large-context scenarios. Start by identifying high-load elements (like calculation-heavy scoring or branching hierarchies) and streamline them into simpler, bucket-based systems demonstrated through curated examples that implicitly embed directives (e.g., showing exact tag usage, entry separation, and filtering in action). Emphasize patterns over prose: integrate diverse examples (including paraphrases and edge cases like updates or anti-pattern ignores) throughout to "teach" behaviors, as Qwen follows these more reliably than standalone rules. Trim redundant text to minimize context bloat, potentially consolidating low-use categories if needed, while keeping the sequential core task intact for Qwen's step-following strength. Prioritize testability—build in ways to reinforce common failure modes (e.g., explicit nudges for missed tags via examples). Finally, iterate pragmatically: after changes, re-test with the monologues to measure improvements in consistency, granularity, and filtering, adjusting based on whether we're hitting 85-90% coverage without hallucinations. This way, we're not overhauling for a bigger model but adapting smartly to what Qwen can handle best—practical results over elegant complexity. Let's dive into VSCode and make it happen!
